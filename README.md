# Code The Book
----
## Purpose:
The focus of this repository is to house my attempts at teaching myself various subjects and attempting to apply this learning through programming.  The intent is to convert what could be more abstract learning into concrete Python code that can be examined, edited, and executed.  It is hoped that this approach will develop a more usable knowledge base for myself and anyone else who wants to contribute.

## Approach:
Because this is a project centered on learning new skills and ideas, the style of the Jupyter Notebooks contained in this repository will follow a basic note taking approach that should be familiar to anyone who has taken a math class.  I will use both inline comments as well as markdown cells to take notes and attempt to employ LaTeX formatting to represent any mathematical formulas.  While they may not remain ideally consistent the desire is to produce notebooks that makes clear all the concepts being dealt with by the Python code.

## Contributions:
I am a firm believer in the power and innovation of the on-line open-source community and I would gratefully welcome any collaboration.  Ultimately I see this project as becoming a collaborative learning experience between people interested in the same approach to a subject.  In that spirit I will attempt to provide links to the particular books I am following along with if it is available on-line.  If it is feasible I would like each Markdown section to have a link to the specific section of the book so that it is easy for anyone reviewing these notebooks to follow along.  While any contributions would be welcome I would request that anyone seeking to participate in this project approach it with the same intent of participative learning.
